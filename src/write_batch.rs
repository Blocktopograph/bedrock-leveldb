/// A batch of write operations (put/delete) that can be committed atomically.
///
/// `WriteBatch` allows you to group multiple write operations (puts and deletes)
/// into a single atomic unit. Either all operations in the batch succeed, or none
/// are applied. This provides strong consistency guarantees and can significantly
/// improve write performance by reducing I/O overhead.
///
/// # Atomicity Guarantees
///
/// When a write batch is committed, LevelDB ensures that:
/// - All operations in the batch are applied atomically
/// - No partial updates are visible to other readers
/// - The batch is durable once the write operation completes successfully
///
/// # Performance Benefits
///
/// Using write batches can provide significant performance improvements:
/// - Reduced I/O overhead by batching multiple operations
/// - Fewer sync operations when using synchronous writes
/// - Better write amplification characteristics
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ## Basic batch operations
/// ```no_run
/// use bedrock_leveldb::{DB, WriteBatch, options::Options};
///
/// # let options = Options::default();
/// # let db = DB::open("test_db", &options).unwrap();
/// let mut batch = WriteBatch::new();
///
/// // Add multiple operations to the batch
/// batch.put(b"key1", b"value1");
/// batch.put(b"key2", b"value2");
/// batch.delete(b"old_key");
///
/// // Commit all operations atomically
/// batch.write(&db, &Default::default()).unwrap();
/// ```
///
/// ## Batch with error handling
/// ```no_run
/// use bedrock_leveldb::{DB, WriteBatch, options::Options};
///
/// # let options = Options::default();
/// # let db = DB::open("test_db", &options).unwrap();
/// let mut batch = WriteBatch::new();
/// batch.put(b"data", b"important information");
///
/// match batch.write(&db, &Default::default()) {
///     Ok(()) => println!("Batch committed successfully"),
///     Err(e) => eprintln!("Failed to write batch: {}", e),
